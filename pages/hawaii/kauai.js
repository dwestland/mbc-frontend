        <h1>Kauai</h1>
        <p>Kauai is one of the most beautiful and lush of the seven Hawaiian Islands. Kauai is known as the &#x34;Garden Isle&#x34; because of the brilliant flowers, such as wild orchids and birds of paradise that grow there. The three most popular resort areas on the Kauai are: Princeville on the North Shore, Coconut Plantation, and Poipu Beach to the south. Some of the many things that travelers enjoy are the exotic flowers, Waimea Canyon, Opaekaa Falls, Mt. Wai&#x27;ale&#x27;ale and Hanalei Bay.</p>

        <p>Princeville is on Kauai&#x27;s North Shore. It is a beautiful, upscale development, set high above the Hanalei Bay. It is home to the luxurious Princeville Hotel and 2 championship golf courses. There you can also taste sweet harvests at the Guava Kai plantation.</p>
        <p>Just past Princeville, beyond the North Shore, is the &#x34;End of the Road&#x34; or Hanalei. The movie South Pacific was filmed at the pier. Also, a glance and the stunning, lush Hanalei Valley is a must. Hanalei is also where one of the best beaches on Kauai is located, Black Pot Beach. This is a 2-mile stretch of sand offering some of the best swimming, surfing and bodysurfing. In the Hanalei Valley you can tour the lush mountains and travel to the amazing Opaekaa Falls, where the Wailua River makes a plunge over a high cliff.</p>
        <p>A must see on Kauai is Waimea Canyon, called &#x34;The Grand Canyon of the Pacific&#x34; by Mark Twain. It is approximately 10 miles long and about 3600 feet deep, surrounded by trees and colorful rock. It is truly a beautiful and memorable sight and well worth the drive.</p>
        <p>At the center of Kauai is Mt. Wai&#x27;ale&#x27;ale, considered the wettest spot on earth. It averages 485 inches of rain per year and is a lush paradise. All of this rainfall creates spectacular waterfalls and rivers. Some of the best waterfalls on the island are: Opeakaa Falls, Papkalea Falls, Wailua Falls and Kipu Falls.</p>
        <p>On the west side of the island is the resort area of Coconut Coast. There are several hotels and resorts to choose from there. Close to the Coconut Coast is the Fern Grotto, accessible by boat down the Wailua River. The Wailua River is an 11-mile long, slowly meandering river. The river starts at the Wai&#x27;ale&#x27;ale Crater and several forks in the river lead to waterfalls. You can even rent a kayak and explore the area yourself. Make sure to stop and visit the Fern Grotto, a beautiful cave that was at one time reserved strictly for Hawaiian Royalty. The Fern Grotto is a little paradise, full of ferns and waterfalls. It has become a favorite spot for weddings.</p>
        <p>On the south side of Kauai is the popular beach resort area of Poipu Beach. This is the &#x34;dryer&#x34; side of Kauai, as compared to the North Shore. It offers excellent beaches, especially for body surfing and snorkeling. There are several resorts, hotels and timeshares clustered in the Poipu Beach area. There are also wonderful shopping areas and great restaurants close by.</p>
        <p>Another beautiful area of Kauai is the Na Pali Coast, with its cliffs and hanging valleys. You can hop aboard a chartered adventure raft and visit hidden caves and go beneath cascading waterfalls. For an added adventure, go ashore and visit an ancient fishing village.</p>
